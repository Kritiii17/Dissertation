# DSM-to-DTM Automation for Volcanic Hazard Modelling


# This project automates the conversion of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) into Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) for volcanic hazard modelling. 

# The pipeline uses deep learning (U-Net / DeepLabV3+) to detect and remove artefacts such as vegetation, buildings, and vehicles from DSMs.


## Repository Structure

# \- `notebooks/` – Colab notebooks with full workflow

# \- `src/` – Python scripts (data loading, model, training, utils)

# \- `docs/` – Diagrams, pipeline figures, results

# \- `requirements.txt` – dependencies

# \- `README.md` – this file


## How to Run

# 1\. Clone the repo:

# &nbsp;  ```bash

# &nbsp;  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Dissertation.git

# &nbsp;  cd Dissertation


# 2\. Install dependencies:

# pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3\. Open notebooks/Dissertation.ipynb in Colab or Jupyter to run the pipeline.
